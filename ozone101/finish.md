Hey, you did it. Just started and used a real Ozone cluster.

If you would like to play with it locally you can download  the two required files:

 1. [docker-compose](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elek/katacoda-scenarios/master/ozone101/assets/docker-compose.yaml)
 2. [config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elek/katacoda-scenarios/master/ozone101/assets/config)

Put them to a directory and use `docker-compose up -d` as before.
